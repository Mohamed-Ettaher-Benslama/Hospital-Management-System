# Hospital-Management-System
The idea behind our project is to better present and understand the data in a hospital and extract meaningful information from it to draw conclusions. The database includes data about patients in the hospital, the doctors working there, the bills, the rooms, and diseases. In fact, the purpose of the project is to keep all data well organized and easily accessible. Our database management system can be very helpful when it comes to dealing with COVID-19. Indeed, the browser of our Project can easily identify COVID-19 cases and execute additional analysis on them in order to better understand the pandemic situation in the hospital and choose the best strategy. In doing So we used several functions, procedures, cursors, exceptions, and triggers as will be better explained below. To make the use of the tools mentioned above easier we put them all in a package. Finally, we linked them to Power BI to better visualize the extracted information.
